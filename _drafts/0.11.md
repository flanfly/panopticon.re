In the last 10 months we started rebuilding Panopticon in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/). We were able to reduce the amount of code from 17k to 12k lines. Hopefully a saver language will help us preventing bugs in the future.

### Installation

Rust projects are built using Cargo. Cargo fetches dependendcies, builds everything and links libraries and executables. Cargo is part of the Rust toolchain you can download at their official website https://rust-lang.org. After you have the toolchain installed. a single ``cargo build --release`` compiles everything. The Panopticon fontend can now be found in ``target/release/qtpanopticon``. Running the unit tests can be done with ``cargo test``.

### Changelog

- **Breaking change:** Switch from C++ to Rust
