We are happy to announce the availability of Panopticon 0.13! This version an important step towards the our goal of making static analysis accessible for reverse engineers.

Panopticon now includes a [Abstract Interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_interpretation) framework that underlies many static analysis algorithms. The framework can be used to implement K-Set[^1] and Value Set Analysis[^2]. For this the Panopticon Intermediate Language (PIL) is converted into [Static Single Assignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form) form first. This led to us implementing a lot data flow and graph algorithms in Panopticon.

Aside from that we welcome our newest contributer [Marcus Brinkmann](http://www.marcus-brinkmann.de/) who wrote a whole disassembler for the [MOS-6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) ÂµC. The MOS-6502 is was used in C64, Apple ][ and the NES. We also continued in the laborious task of writing a disassembler for Intel x86/AMD64. The implementation is now able to decode most instructions used including SSE, MMX, AVX and the FPU.

### Changelog
- Decode most AMD64 instructions
- Basic Abstract Interpretation framework
- SSA conversion of PIL code
- MOS-6502 support (thanks to Marcus Brinkmann)
