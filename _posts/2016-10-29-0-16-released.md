We're happy to announce the availability of [Panopticon 0.16](https://files.panopticon.re/0.16)!
This milestone took longer than anticipated, but it sure is worth the wait. The
improvements coming with 0.16 are less with code base and more with
supporting parts:

 - Panopticon now has [API Documentation](https://doc.panopticon.re/panopticon/index.html)
   covering the majority of the code base. This will make it easier for new
	 contributers to write patches.

 - We now have a [User Guide](https://panopticon.re/usage) and
   [pre built binaries](https://panopticon.re/get) to help newcomers to try out
	 Panopticon.

This does not mean that version 0.16 has no new features. Panopticon now
starts with a title screen to make it more self explanatory. Also, the control
flow graph now displays errors in line with code so you can see where things went
wrong.

To make Panopticon simpler to compile, we got rid of the dependency on GLPK and
replaced it with the [cassowary-rs](https://github.com/dylanede/cassowary-rs) crate.

The most important new feature is an ELF loader that works with static and
dynamic linked binaries. Panopticon replaced its own ELF loader with the
excellent [goblin](https://github.com/m4b/goblin) crate. Thanks the its
maintainer [**@m4b**](https://github.com/m4b) for the hard work!

We also thank all who contributed to this release:

 - Andre Bogus
 - Harris Brakmic
 - Jean Pierre Dudey
 - Kai Michaelis
 - Stefan Schindler
 - Tobias Bucher
 - m4b
